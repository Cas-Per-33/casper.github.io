Hello. Began to perform independent tasks from Ð¡odecademy courses. I need to create a site myself based on a certain example and page styles https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg?_gl=1*14o7g01*_ga*MjI5MTM4NzIxLjE2NTY4MDYxODA .*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L* MTY1OTg5NTg2OC4zMC4xLjE2NTk4OTYzMjMuNTk. The course offers its own solution to this problem, which is slightly different from mine. These are my first steps in creating a website on my own, so I will be grateful for advice, criticism and words of support. Thank you all in advance.
